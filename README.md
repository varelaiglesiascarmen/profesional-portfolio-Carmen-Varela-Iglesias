## Introduction
This repository contains my Professional Portfolio, a personal website that I have designed and developed entirely using Bootstrap 5, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its purpose is to showcase my projects, skills, and professional journey as a Front-End Developer.

I have always been passionate about art, and I have discovered that when combined with technology, it opens up a world of endless possibilities. I focus on building **clean, efficient, and visually appealing interfaces**, combining good development practices with attention to design and user experience.
I developed this portfolio to present it in selection processes, showcasing my work, my knowledge, and my development style.

## Portfolio Objective

- Showcase relevant academic and personal projects.
- Demonstrate skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design with Bootstrap.
- Reflect my professional identity: attention to detail, organized code, and user experience.
- Serve as a cover letter to recruiters or potential collaborators.

## Technologies used

- Bootstrap 5 for responsive design, reusable components, and modern UI.
- HTML5 and CSS3 for semantic structure, styles, and adaptive design.
- JavaScript to add interactivity when necessary.
- Git and GitHub for version control, code organization, and repository management.
